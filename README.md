# Island Simulation
## Overview
This project is centered around simulating an ecosystem with various organisms, including animals and plants. The simulation incorporates features such as movement, nutrition, reproduction, and interactions between different types of organisms. The primary interface for user interaction is through a command-line interface (CLI).

## Achievements
- Implemented a comprehensive ecosystem simulation with diverse organisms, including herbivores, omnivores, and predators.
- Integrated movement, nutrition, and reproduction mechanisms for both animals and plants.
- Developed a command-line interface (CLI).
- Designed a flexible and extensible architecture that allows for easy addition of new organisms or features.

## Project Features
- **Organism Diversity:** Includes various animal species categorized as herbivores, omnivores, and predators, as well as different plant types.
- **Dynamic Ecosystem:** The simulation dynamically simulates the interactions and movements of organisms within the ecosystem over multiple rounds.
- **Animal Movement:** Animals can move within the ecosystem, with their speed and target locations determined by the simulation logic.
- **Nutrition Handling:** Implemented nutrition mechanisms, including eating other organisms and maintaining saturation levels.
- **Reproduction:** Animals and plants can reproduce under specific conditions, contributing to the growth of their populations.
- **Ecosystem Simulation Engine:** Designed an engine that orchestrates the simulation rounds, handling different aspects of the ecosystem.

## Running the Simulation
### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Using an IDE.
    - Open the project in your preferred IDE.
    - Run the `Main` class, ensuring that the dependencies are included in the classpath.

### Simulation Control
1. After launching the simulation, it will start running through multiple rounds.
2. The simulation state, including the number of plants and animals in each cell, will be displayed after each round.
3. The simulation will continue until all organisms are extinct.
